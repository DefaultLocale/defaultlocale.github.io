Hello, my name is Aidar, I'm a software developer and I'm starting a blog today.

For a long time I wanted to start blogging. I didn't have any particular reason for that, just a deep primal urge, but if you would force me to give a reason, I'd say that I just want to have a place to store my personal notes. As Adam Bien puts it in his blog ([My Blog is a Personal Notepad][adam-bien-notepad]):

> In the second post of this blog "Why blogging?" eleven years ago I was not sure about the whole point of blogging. After 11 years, my blog became a personal reference ([archive.adam-bien.com]([adam-bien-archive]) ) and notepad which I frequently use in my consulting / development / client work. I capture code snippets, ideas and sometimes expose my personal opinion and I'm curious about reader's feedback.

I hope to use this blog in the same way. To have my place in cyberspace. To keep an archive of my thoughts and ideas, so next time when somebody asks me for a code snippet or a tutorial I'll just give her/him a link. 

I'm planning to keep this blog active and to post quick and dirty tehnology tips relatively often. For last seven years I'm developing enterprise applications with Java EE (mostly portal solutions based on [Liferay][liferay]) and C#/.Net (desktop applications on Windows Forms/WPF), so I naturally expect my posts to concentrate around my area of expertise. But who knows, maybe I'll learn some stuff along the way.  

About this blog
---

Currently, this blog is build on [Github Pages][pages] with [Jekyll][jekyll]. Here is a link to a tutorial, if you need it: [Using Jekyll as a static site generator with GitHub Pages][pages-tutorial].

As for now, literally nobody reads this, so I'll use this opportunity to experiment recklessly on a live version. Break some things, rewrite everything from scratch if necessary. You know, usual staff for a beginner. 

Well, that's it for now, we'll see how it goes.
